// My Mission setup:
// 1. Create a Google Sheet with columns:
//    Week, PublishDate, ScriptureReference, ScriptureText, Thoughts, MissionUpdate,
//    Google Photos album, Google Photos links, Status, Notes
// 2. Connect the sheet through a JSON service like OpenSheet. The browser
//    fetches this URL at page load, so sheet edits do not require a rebuild.
// 3. Paste the shared Google Photos album URL into the "Google Photos album" column.
// 4. Paste individual Google Photos photo links into the "Google Photos links" column.
//    Separate multiple links with new lines, commas, semicolons, or spaces.
// 5. Set Status to Published when a week should appear.
//
// OpenSheet endpoint format:
// https://opensheet.elk.sh/YOUR_SHEET_ID/Sheet1
//
// Google Photos note:
// Google Photos page links usually cannot be used as direct image files. Regular
// photos.google.com links are shown as clickable photo cards. Direct image URLs
// ending in .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, or .gif, plus googleusercontent.com image
// URLs, are displayed as lazy-loaded embedded images.
